     * First, create an integer variable to keep track of the stringâ€™s midpoint.
     * Remember that integers in C++ disregard any decimal places so 2.5 converted into an integer will be 2. 
     * Next, set up the first loop to iterate from the beginning to midpoint of the string. 
     * Then, set up the second loop to iterate through the remainder of the string. 
     * After the first loop, make sure to use a cout << endl to separate the two strings. 
     * However, this is optional for the second loop. */
