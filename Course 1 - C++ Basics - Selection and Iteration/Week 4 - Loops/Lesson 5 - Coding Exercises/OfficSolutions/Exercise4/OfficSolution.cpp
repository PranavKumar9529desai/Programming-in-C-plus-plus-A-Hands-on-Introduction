     * In order to print Print me!, the conditional expression of (i == 0) needs to be true. 
     * However, i starts at 100 and thus the program will execute the else condition which contains a while(true) statement. 
     * This statement causes the while loop to always run, which forces i to increment by 1 after every iteration, making it impossible for i to ever reach 0. 
     * Therefore, a break; statement is needed before i++ to prevent the while loop from incrementing i. 
     * This break; statement will cause the while loop to do nothing and exit every time it runs. 
     * Then all thatâ€™s left is to wait for the for loop to decrement i until it becomes 0 and prints Print me!. 
     * Once that happens, the other break; statement after cout << "Print me!" << endl; will force the for loop to exit and terminate the program.
