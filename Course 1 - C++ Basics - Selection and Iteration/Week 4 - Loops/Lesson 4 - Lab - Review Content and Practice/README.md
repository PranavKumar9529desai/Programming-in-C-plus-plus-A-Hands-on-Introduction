# Lab: For Loop

## Tutorial Lab 1: Using the For Loop

Try out the code below
```cpp
for (int x = 0; x < 11; x++) {
    if (x % 2 == 0) {
        cout << "Even" << endl;
    }
    else {
        cout << "Odd" << endl;
    }
}
```

__Program Summary__

1. The `for` loop runs through all the values of the variable `x` from 0 to 10 as specified in the loop header.
2. For each value of `x`, an expression is evaluated using a conditional `if` statement.
3. If `x` modulo `2` evaluates to 0, then print `Even` followed by a newline character.
4. If `x` modulo `2` does not evaluate to 0, then print `Odd` instead followed by a newline character.

# Lab: While Loop

## Tutorial Lab 2: The While Loop

Try out the code below
```cpp
int counter = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
    cout << counter << endl;
    counter = counter + 1;
}
cout << "while loop ended" << endl;
```

__Program Summary__

1. A `counter` variable is initialized to keep track of how many times the loop will be executed.
2. The loop will run as long as `counter` is less than 10.
3. Each time the loop runs, the integer value of `counter` is printed to the screen.
4. The value of `counter` is then incremented by 1.
5. When `counter` reaches `10`, the boolean expression no longer evaluates to true and the program will exit the loop.
6. Before the program terminates, a statement is printed to the screen, indicating that the `while` loop has ended.
7. Recall that the `while` loop must have an exit condition. By incrementing the `counter` variable, we ensure that the loop will eventually end. If we do not increment `counter` in this loop, we will create an infinite loop because `counter` will never reach 10 or greater.

> > The `while` loop in choice #2 executes but is ended once `lives` reaches `0` due to `lives` being decremented after each iteration.

# Lab: Break Statement

## Tutorial Lab 3: Breaking from the While Loop

Try out the code below
```cpp
double result = 0;
double input;

while (true) {
    cout << "Enter a number to add to sum. "; 
    cout << "Or enter a non-number to quit and calculate sum." << endl;
    cin >> input;
    if (cin.good()) {
        result += input;
    }
    if (cin.fail()) {
        cout << "Sum = " << result << endl;
        break;
    }
}
```

> <b>What does `cin >> input;` do?</b>
> 
> The `cin >> input;` command records what a user enters on the screen and stores that information in the variable `input`. Note that `input` is of type `double`.

> <b>What do `cin.good()` and `cin.fail()` do?</b>
> 
> `cin.good()` checks to see if the input entered by the user was successful while `cin.fail()` checks to see if the input failed. Since `input` is of type `double`, only numerical values entered by the user will cause `cin >> input` to be successful, anything else will cause the input to fail.

__Program Summary__

1. Declare the variable `result` and initialize it to `0`. `result` will store the total of the summation.
2. Declare the variable `input`. `input` will store the information that the user enters.
3. Next we set up a `while` loop with `true` as the expression in the loop header. We do this because we want the loop to continue running and storing information from the user. Since we donâ€™t know how much information the user will enter, a `while` loop is best for the situation.
4. The user is prompted to enter some information and that information is stored in the variable `input` which was declared earlier.
5. If the information was stored into `input` successfully, the value in `input` will be added to the value in `result`, our total summation.
6. If the information was not stored into `input` successfully, then the program will print out the total summation `result` and exit the `while` loop.

> <b>Infinite Loop Solution</b>
> 
> The following program results in an infinite loop:
> ```cpp
> string s;
> 
> while (true) {
>     cout << "Enter a lowercase vowel." << endl;
>     cin >> s;
>     if (s=="a" || s=="e" || s=="i" || s=="o" || s=="u") {
>         cout << "You successfully entered a vowel." << endl;
>     }
>     else {
>         cout << "You did not enter a vowel." << endl;
>     }
> }
> ```
> Select __all__ of the solutions below that will enable the program to resolve this infinite loop.
> - Insert a `break;` statement on the line after `cout << "You successfully entered a vowel." << endl;`.
> - Insert a `break;` statement on the line after `cout << "You did not enter a vowel." << endl;`.
> - Replace `while (true)` with `for (true)`.
> - Remove `cin >> s;`
>

> > <b>Rationale:</b>
> > 
> > By definition, an __infinite loop__ occurs when a program has no test conditions to cause a loop to stop. The program above will indefinitely ask the user for input and store that input regardless of what the user enters.

# Lab Challenge: Loop Patterns

## Nested Loop Example

One of the benefits of nested loops is that they can be used to construct complex patterns. Imagine a classroom full of students and they are distributed evenly into smaller groups and asked to form a single line with their groups. The outer loop is like the group leader (represent in __red__ and `L`) and the inner loop is like the rest of the group members (represented in __blue__ and `M`.

<img src="./images/img1.png" width=300>

```cpp
for (int x = 0; x < 3; x++) {
    cout << "L" << endl;
    for (int y = 0; y < 3; y++) {
        cout << "M" << endl;
    }
}
```

What is the pattern described by the above example? There are 3 leaders and __each__ leader has 3 members. However, note that the example shows the students standing in a _vertical_ line. What if you want to arrange the students in a _horizontal_ line like this instead?

<img src="./images/img2.png" width=500>

By removing the `<< endl` commands from the code above, you can accomplish this task. Alternatively, you can also make use of an `if` and `else` statement instead of a nested loop. Both ways will produce the same result.

```cpp
for (int x = 0; x < 3; x++) {
    cout << "L";
    for (int y = 0; y < 3; y++) {
        cout << "M";
    }
}
```

```cpp
for (int x = 0; x < 12; x++) {
    if ((x == 0) || (x == 4) || (x == 8)) {
        cout << "L";
    }
    else {
        cout << "M";
    }
}
```
