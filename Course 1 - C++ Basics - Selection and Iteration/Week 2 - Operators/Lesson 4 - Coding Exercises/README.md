# Coding Exercises

## Exercise 1
Given the code below
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    //fix the code below this line

    int a = 5;
    string b = 9;

    //fix the code above this line

    cout << (a * 3 + b - 8 / 2) << endl;
    
    return 0;

}
```

Complete the code such that the code returns `17`. Please note there are _two_ types of errors present in the code:

1. A __compilation error__ - the compiler sees a problem and throws an error to alert you.
2. A __run-time error__ - an error when the code is running.

> <b>Compilation Error Hint</b>

> An example of a compilation error would be 
> ```cpp
> int number = "this is not an int";.
> ```

> <b>Compilation Error</b>
> 
> When you have fixed the compilation error, click the button below to check your work.
> 
> > The compilation bug is located on the following line:
> > ```cpp
> > string b = 9;
> > ```
> > 
> > The bug is that `b` is declared as a `string` but is being assigned to `9` which is an `int`. To correct this, you would replace `string` with `int` which results in:
> > ```cpp
> > int b = 9;
> > ```

> <b>Run-Time Error Hint</b>
> 
> Once you fix the compilation error, you will see that the code output does not match what the exercise asks for.

> <b>Try Debugging</b>
> 
> Debugging is a set of practices used to remove bugs (defects or flaws within a program). One way is to print out useful information. Try printing out what the variables should be to get to __17__:
> 
> $a = 17 -$ $\frac{b - 8/2}{3}$
> 
> $b = 17 - a * 3 + \frac{8}{2}$
> 
> You can also try tweaking the variables to see how that changes the output of the code. For example, what happens when you try assigning `a` to `6` instead of `5`?

## Exercise 2
Given the code below
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    // add code below this line



    // add code above this line

    return 0;

}
```

Using _ONLY_ __numbers and operators__, print an expression that evaluates to `false`. Make sure to use `cout << boolalpha <<` in your code. Otherwise, the system will print `0` or `1` instead of `false` or `true`.

## Exercise 3
Given the code below
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    // add code below this line



    // add code above this line

    return 0;

}
```

Write a program that outputs `Hello world`. Your program __must__ do the following things:
1. Use __two__ variables, one assigned to `Hello ` and the other assigned to `world`.
2. Use just __one__ `cout << ` statement.

## Exercise 4
Given the code below
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    // add code below this line



    // add code above this line

    return 0;

}
```

Write a program that divides `7` by `2` and prints out the result (`3.5`) __without__ using the `printf()` command. Your program __must__ do the following things:
1. Declare __two__ variables and assign them to the appropriate values, and __use__ them to calculate your quotient of `3.5`.
2. Include just __one__ division (`/`) operator in your code.
3. Use just __one__ `cout << ` statement.

## Exercise 5
Given the code below
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    string num1;
    string num2;
    cout << "Type the first whole number and then press Enter or Return: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Type the second whole number and then press Enter or Return: ";
    cin >> num1;

    //fix the code below this line

    string sum = num1 + num2;
    cout << ( num1 + " + " + num2 + " = " + sum ) << endl;

    //fix the code above this line

    return 0;

}
```

Your friend wrote a program called an __adder__. The adder is supposed to take two numbers inputted by a user and then find the sum of those numbers, but itâ€™s behaving oddly.

Your first task is to figure out what is wrong with the adder. Your second task is to fix it.

#### Hint(s) to identify the problem
Try entering `1` and `1`. You expect the output to be `2` but you get `11` instead. Similarly, if you enter `3` and `4`, you expect the output to be `7` but you get `34`. Remember, __string concatenation__ also uses the `+` operator.

#### Hint(s) to identify the solution
The `+` operator functions differently based on the type of data that comes before and after it. What data types will cause the `+` operator to calculate a __mathematical__ sum? What data type is present in the program now? How do you convert from one data type to another? Check out the __Type Casting__ page for some ideas.
